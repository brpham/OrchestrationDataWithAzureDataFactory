42748678,,,4,27/09/2019,23/09/2019,,,,read,,1,"Quite a nice little collection of stories and poems.<br/>Broken up with some long stories, some shorter stories and some poetry.<br/>Some are quite disturbing, some could be used as the basis of novels. There was more to tell in such stories as The Unforgiving Court and the Fifty Mile House. Both lend themselves to more stories or an  extended novel length story.<br/>I'll admit the poems didn't work for me, but then I've never been that big on poetry, so take my comment with a grain of salt.<br/>The Christmas tales at the end were on the disturbing side. Nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>Look out for a copy, pick it up and have a good read. "
47508874,,,5,23/09/2019,27/08/2019,,,,read,,1,"Overall Review:<br/>DISCLAIMER: Before we proceed, I’m an author friend of Steve’s and have been featured in a number of his anthologies and magazines. Steve approached me to review “Deeper, Darker things” and I jumped at the chance. I have tried to remain impartial, but freely admit that it’s a hard task when granted the opportunity to review such a great collection of stories.<br/><br/>Dillon writes in a wonderful literary style that smacks of having grown up in England. His style is very cerebral, relying more on evoking a feeling of dread in the back of the reader’s mind rather than an outright visceral attack on their senses.<br/>He states that his favourite authors are Ramsay Campbell and Clive Barker. Their influence can be seen in the way he approaches his writing, leaving the reader wondering whether Dillon’s style has been drawn from Campbell’s/Barker’s, or whether Dillon was drawn to them because of his style.<br/>As a whole this is an eclectic and almost eccentric collection. The title sums it up perfectly. These are tales of deeper, darker things. Most are cerebral, hitting the reader deep in their mind like a sledgehammer. Some even stay with you long after you’ve moved away from the book.<br/>Each story can be read in isolation, but the two presented from the Refuge collection garner a wish in the reader’s soul to seek out those anthologies and plunge into the world of Refuge and its sister town Bliss. Each location pops up multiple times along the way, weaving a common thread of shared geography and community through many of the stories.<br/><br/>Below is a short appraisal of each story:<br/><br/>Deeper, Darker things<br/>Very good, very Lovecraftian. Very much in the heavy literary style of Lovecraft, but with a nice deft finish that had me smiling.<br/><br/>The Scary Man<br/>Wow. For such a short story this had a massive gut punch of an ending.<br/><br/>Panopticon<br/>Great line: “the only fear I have these days is the thought of being summoned to a meeting” – sounds like me at work.<br/>A very dark tale which mixes 1984 with the Cthulhu mythos and War of the Worlds. Really quite good.<br/><br/>A Rapid Fingering<br/>Good. A creepy little horror sex tale that could probably be used in Steve’s up-coming “Guilty Pleasures” anthology.<br/><br/><br/>The Marshmallow People<br/>Steve asked me to read this one a fair while ago and it still reads well. One of those little tales grounded in reality which can provide more of a fright that any imagined monster.<br/><br/>Bliss Pond<br/>Great opening paragraph. Would instil the dream of being a teacher into even the hardest nut. "

I read a revised edition, which did seem as polished and professional as his later works. Though, it was through the gutsy decision to self-publish his first book that he landed the contract that catapulted him to mega-stardom.<br/>Reilly's style shines through in this book.<br/>It is fast paced, non-stop and leaves little time to catch your breath as a reader.<br/>I managed to finish it in six days, though a lot of that was on a bus trip to Sydney.<br/>Contest has all the hallmarks of what would become Reilly's style. Simple characters, with a degree of intelligence that is used to escape death-defying scenarios. Even at this first outing, Reilly introduces what will become a common attribute of his hero's. They are human. They have flaws, but they have an inner sense of their own extraordinary abilities.<br/>Stephen Swain is no different. He's an ER doctor, he eschews the use of weapons or the need to kill anything that resembles a human being. Animals not so much.<br/>His main flaw in this story is his humanity. He has a need to protect those around him. His daughter. A policeman caught up in the chaos, and even an alien he'd never met before.<br/>The plot of Contest is intriguing. Seven members of different alien species are teleported into the New York City library building. There to do battle to the death until one victor remains.<br/>From there Reilly throws in multiple curve balls that leave the contestants and the reader reeling.<br/>This is a fun filled, action packed thriller that marks the beginning of an incredible career.<br/>As a writer, I dream of being able to mimic Reilly's style, and especially his popularity."

The funfair and boardwalk are featured prominently, with all the disturbing scenes that can come of what hides in the dark recesses of those rides and games.<br/>The volume is a little shorter than past entries in the series, but buckle up for a short fast paced thrill ride that you'll never forget.

Released four years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's (earlier when being written), he would have known what his future held and began a period of self-reflection.<br/>This book is also pretty sad as it was to become the last of the City Watch series, and the last for Sam Vimes. It focuses heavily on Vimes himself and asks a lot of serious questions about his role, his future and his life.<br/>The story of snuff also focuses on the plight of the goblins. Until now these creatures have been painted as a species of higher homonids, but still much below others in the hierarchy. It is through Vimes and the Summoning Dark (the demon this shares his mind) that we learn the goblins are a sophisticated society that have been shunned into a state of servitude and fear by others. The goblins possibly reflect Pratchett's love of orangutans and their struggle.<br/>The Summoning Dark was another interesting aspect and seemed to reflect Pratchett's realisation that his disease was co-habiting his mind in much the same way and Vimes's relationship with the Dark reflected Pratchett's relationship and possible fear of losing to the disease.<br/>Overall, Snuff is a great book, with some fun aspects and some slightly sad moments.<br/>The City Watch is left forever changed in some ways at the end, but until someone else takes up the mantle they will forever remain as such.<br/><br/>PS: In the end this book was hard for me to read, as it was one of the few remaining Discworld books I hadn't read."

An action packed story, with a very interesting writing style, and some loopy science-fantasy. I won't called it Science Fiction cause I don't think it belongs in that category.<br/>The plot concentrated more on John Carter's off-sider Vor Daj and involved a strange cloning technique that was more about growing sub-humans in vats than cloning.<br/>It was an interesting excursion into Burroughs's world and one I haven't undertaken since my teens (I read all of the Venus books).<br/>Well worth the journey."

Some are simple, some could become novels.<br/>There is humour, terror, darkness and light.<br/><br/>The biggest warning I would give though is, a collection of drabbles is a series of sprints not a marathon. Even five minutes of reading leaves your mind reeling at the world building, the ideas, the number of stories built in your brain and ended a hundred words.<br/>Take your time. Absorb and digest each story on its merits. Then move on. You will be much better for the experience."

Most focus on the creation of the creature, but Shelley glosses over that in only a few paragraphs.<br/>The story is really about the human side of the creature's dual personality and that of Frankenstein's slide into a virtual world of insanity and hatred toward the creature.<br/>Long, fairly enjoyable, but I was really wanting that last page to arrive."

397867,333761189,9780330000000,4,,28/03/2017,,,,read,,1,"BOOK REVIEW – The Rats (1974) by James Herbert – 4.5/5<br/><< WARNING – CONTAINS SPOILERS >><br/>I recently finished reading “By Horror Haunted” a series of essays about and interviews with James Herbert. It was collected and edited in 1990 while Herbert was still writing Creed. Herbert has always been my favourite author and the book was fascinating as it gave a deep insight into how Herbert worked, his motivations and some of the struggles he had to deal with during his career.<br/>So, it made me want to revisit some of Herbert’s early works.<br/>His first novel was “The Rats” which he wrote while still working full time in advertising. The other freaky piece of information was that Herbert wrote long hand on paper and only made cursory changes in the rewrite phase. I was blown away.<br/><< PLOT >><br/>In the poor, depressed parts of East London, several suffer attacks from a new species of black rat. Larger, more ferocious and intelligent than the common brown rat, and definitely not afraid of humans. They also carry a nasty disease which proves fatal within 24 hours of being bitten.<br/>A local teacher Harris, is introduced to the plague by one of his students being bitten. Having grown up in the area, he visits the place where his student was attacked and sees first hand a pack of rats. He brings in the Police and is co-opted to help a local exterminator to find the rats’ lair. Discovering a possible location, Harris goes to bring help and the exterminator seeks them out, but is killed.<br/>While the authorities contemplate what to do, the attacks become more brazen, including an entire tube train and Harris’ school.<br/>The Government strike back using a virus which seems to do the job. All is quiet for several weeks until an outbreak in a cinema and the London zoo. The virus has had one major advantage, the rats’ disease has been reduced to non-fatal.<br/>The authorities’ next move is to use ultra-sonic frequencies to attract the rats to a large park and douse them in gas.<br/>Harris, however, follows the disgraced Health Minister Foskins to the possible source of the rats. An abandoned house owned by a zoologist who had studied the rodents in the tropics. Harris finds Foskin’s body and is attacked by a few larger more brutal rats. Finishing them off, he discovers the white hairless dual headed king rat. He kills it and leaves.<br/>The epilogue tells us that one pregnant female lived. She gives birth to a large litter and one hairless white rat with a growing second head.<br/><< END PLOT >><br/>This novel was ground breaking when it came out. It was released before Stephen King’s Carrie and the first paperback version sold out in three weeks. I’d liken its impact on the horror genre to Black Sabbath’s impact on rock music. It created a new sub-genre of horror or a redefinition of what horror was all about.<br/>It was hailed down by the literati as filth and not worthy of consideration as a proper novel. Critics were harsh with their contempt over the supposed gratuitous violence, gore and sex. Herbert answered criticism of his work, in this way, by saying that he only included the “nasty” elements where they were required by the story. The book is about giant rats attacking people, so it ain’t gonna be nice is it?<br/>What sets this book apart from a lot of other works is the style in which the story is presented. It starts out with a series of vignettes focusing on individual characters who then meet horrible deaths at the teeth of the rats.<br/>This is something that Herbert carries on through many of his other novels. I love it. His novels almost become a collection of short stories linked by a common theme and interspersed with the backbone of the main plot. What is more interesting is that during his entire career, Herbert only published six short stories.<br/>The Rats (and probably Herbert’s follow up novels The Fog and The Survivor) can also lay claim to a creating a new breed of horror writer. The likes of Guy N. Smith, Shaun Hutson and Richard Laymon can all tip their hat to Herbert for breaking new ground for them, and we can be even more thankful for it.<br/>Overall, the plot is relatively simple, but the vignettes involving the rat attacks add flesh to the skeleton of Harris’ travails against the rats.<br/>There are some massive holes in the plot that can be glossed over through the pure enjoyment of the story and the writing.<br/>I still can’t understand why the Department of Health and the Police kept Harris around for. The flimsy reasoning was that he knew the area and he was the only person to have survived an encounter with the rats.<br/>Harris himself is an interesting protagonist and it is through his eyes that we see what Herbert’s reasoning was for writing this book. Having grown up in the East End himself, Herbert used his portrayal of Harris as a way of describing his criticism of the way the East of London had been neglected by the Government for so long. By focusing on a fictitious plague of rats that could breed undetected and cause so much damage, he was bringing the attention of all his readers to the plight of those living in the East End.<br/>His description of how the area was finally redeveloped was a way of showing what could (and should) be achieved in his old stamping ground.<br/>So, basically, the book is political protest written as abject horror.<br/>The book was filmed as “Deadly Eyes” in 1982, but Herbert denounces it as a piece of crap. It gets 4.4 on IMDB with the logline reading “Contaminated grain breeds overgrown, killer rats in this Golden Harvest production. Dachshunds were dressed up as rats for the special effects.”<br/>I’m not sure if it’s selling the Dachshunds as the best part of the movie or worst.<br/>The Rats is only 181 and is well worth the read. Herbert wrote two sequels “Lair” in 1979 and “Domain” in 1984. My mum bought them for me in a boxed set back in the late 80’s and I plan to finish off the other two very soon.<br/>But first I want to read my favourite Herbert book again. The Fog."
