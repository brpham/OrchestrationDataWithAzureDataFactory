It tells the stories of Sendatsu, an elf who is attempting to discover why elves and humans have been separated; Huw, a bard from Vales, who is trying to save his countrymen from the king of Forland; and Rhiannon, a dancer whose father has been trying to use her as a bargaining chip with the Forlish king.

It is interesting not only because of her story, but for the glimpses of life in Iceland in the late 1820s, which is so far removed from my own experience that I can't really begin to imagine what it must have been like.<br/><br/>Agnes has been convicted of murdering two men, and condemned to death by beheading.  Until sentence is carried out, she is sent to live with the family of District Officer Jon Jonsson on their farm, and the book tells of their lives until her sentence is carried out.<br/><br/>I liked this book very much.

No, she gives it to a professor of English literature who is directing a play for a very small group of actors. <br/><br/>I can't say any more about it because I gave up at this point.

Was it worth the time?  As I did it, it must have been, on some level, but I still couldn't say I enjoyed it.  It will probably be another two years before I read the next one, and then it will be mainly because I've already invested quite a lot of time in the series so far.<br/><br/>I read in someone else's review that they had never known an author to be so in love with her characters as Diana Gabaldon is with Claire and Jamie, and I agree with that.  I am a bit over all of their absorption, which spoils what could be a good read from an interesting premise - time travel is a fascinating area of literature and gives the author a lot of scope for characters.  <br/><br/>I'm glad it's finished and I can move on to something else.  And I'm sure the next one will be read sometime, I do want to find out what happens to them all, but it might be a while.",,,1,
